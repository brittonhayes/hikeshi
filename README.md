## About Hikeshi

The name comes from the firefighting system established in Japan during the Edo period. Incident response involves a lot of "firefighting" in the sense that you're only called upon when something has gone very wrong. In high stress situations, it's nice to have a simple tool that assists you while you fight those fires. The primary hope for this application is to create a tool that doesn't get in the way or add to the stress of incident response. It aims to be simple, reliable, and unobtrusive.

### Highlights

- No cluttered UI.
- No noisey in-app notifications.
- Web Hooks encourage you to integrate with slack.
- Dark mode support by default.
- Designed specifically for incident response.

It isn't feature packed, but it does exactly what it needs to while you take care of the incidents at hand.
